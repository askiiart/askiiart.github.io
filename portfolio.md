# Portfolio

## Projects

- askiiart/universal-fast-stable-diffusion
  - A semi-universal version of [TheLastBen/fast-stable-diffusion](https://github.com/TheLastBen/fast-stable-diffusion), it just requires a supported GPU and the dependencies to be installed.
- [askiiart.net](https://askiiart.net)
  - My site. I've got a bunch of services running on it, like [Gitea](https://git.askiiart.net), [Invidious](https://invidious.askiiart.net), and an [archive of Windows `.iso` files](https://askiiart.net/archives/iso-and-stuff/Windows/).
  - [askiiart/askiiart-net](https://git.askiiart.net/askiiart/askiiart-net) - The site's source code.
- [askiiart/docker-composer](https://git.askiiart.net/askiiart/docker-composer)
  - Some little convenience scripts for docker compose. The main thing is to compose a bunch of stuff at once.
