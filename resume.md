## Professional Experience

- I run a computer repair business (Ben's PC Repair) out of my home.  I do this on the side, but may expand it.
  - I have no other professional experience.

## [Portfolio](https://askiiart.net/portfolio.html)

Highlights:

- askiiart/universal-fast-stable-diffusion
  - A semi-universal version of [TheLastBen/fast-stable-diffusion](https://github.com/TheLastBen/fast-stable-diffusion), it just requires a supported GPU and the dependencies to be installed.
- [askiiart/askiiart-net](https://git.askiiart.net/askiiart/askiiart-net)
  - My site's source code - check 
- [askiiart.net](https://askiiart.net)
  - My site. I've got a bunch of services running on it, like [Gitea](https://git.askiiart.net), [Invidious](https://invidious.askiiart.net), and an [archive of Windows `.iso` files](https://askiiart.net/archives/iso-and-stuff/Windows/).

## Academics

- Collegiate Academy of Birdville sophomore student (graduating in 2025)
  - This is an early college high school, meaning I simultaneously take high school and college courses. When I graduate, I will graduate with both my associateâ€™s degree from Tarrant County College, and my high school diploma.
- I have completed 25 credit hours of college courses (29 if you include AP credits)

## Extracurriculars and community service

- I am cofounder and current vice president of the [TCCD CompSci and Coding Club](https://codeberg.org/TCCD-CompSci-and-Coding-Club/).
- I do about 20 hours of community service per year.
