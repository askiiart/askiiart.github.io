# Foooooonts!

site update: uh yeah there's fonts now

---

i've got [Atkinson Hyperlegible](https://brailleinstitute.org/freefont) for text, and [FiraCode Nerd Mono](https://github.com/ryanoasis/nerd-fonts/tree/master/patched-fonts/FiraCode) for code now, so it'll look the same on all computers, not beautiful or horrific depending on what fonts your system has installed.

also uh turns out the `code` and `pre` stuff in my CSS file was completely useless since it got overridden by [prism.js](https://prismjs.com/) anyways, so that's gone now

yeah that's it, byeeeeee
