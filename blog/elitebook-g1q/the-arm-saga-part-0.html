        <p>Part 0's gonna be really short, simple, and disorganized,
        just going over some things quick. Also, this is as far as I
        understand it, which isn't very far; I could be wrong, and if I
        have any corrections or anything, then this page will be
        updated.</p>
        <h2 id="basics">Basics</h2>
        <p>ARM laptops are different from x86 ones (duh), rather than
        the core system being universal and stuff just requiring
        different drivers, Linux on ARM requires device trees like <a
        href="https://github.com/aarch64-laptops/build/pull/135/commits/394fae75a113093f9680eb815e683818254e1fa0">this</a>.
        These device trees are then added to the kernel and it Just
        Works... except currently, the Elitebook G1q device tree isn't
        in the kernel, and it's not expected to be until at least
        6.16.</p>
        <h2 id="ubuntu-concept">Ubuntu Concept</h2>
        <p>Ubuntu has a concept image available <a
        href="https://discourse.ubuntu.com/t/ubuntu-24-10-concept-snapdragon-x-elite/48800">here</a>
        that supports the Elitebook G1q's sister laptop, the Omnibook X
        14. When I tried it on my laptop, I had to force it to use the
        Omnibook X 14's device tree, which matches up with what was
        reported <a
        href="https://discourse.ubuntu.com/t/ubuntu-24-10-concept-snapdragon-x-elite/48800/573">here</a>.
        Changing the grub argument from <code>$dtb</code> to
        <code>devicetree /casper/dtbs/x1e80100-hp-omnibook-x14.dtb</code>[^1]
        (which I found by just mounting the iso) worked to get it
        booted. However, it would throws a bunch of weird errors and try
        to netboot, then after going through that, would drop me into a
        busybox session? So that's definitely some improvement over
        nothing, and an alternate way to do stuff if needed, but not
        ideal.</p>
        <p>And I couldn't find a decent way to work this in, but: it
        also behaved a bit strangely, both the keyboard and a USB
        keyboard wouldn't be recognized in Grub ~50% of the time, not
        sure why. I <em>think</em> they would have worked once Ubuntu
        was actually started, but given Grub wouldn't auto-boot, I
        couldn't test this.</p>
        <p>Another side note: I also tested Fedora's ARM image,
        unsurprisingly it didn't work at all.</p>
        <h2 id="the-plan">The Plan</h2>
        <p>Currently, the plan is as follows:</p>
        <ol type="1">
        <li>Either figure out how to compile the dtbs, or just steal
        them from the Ubuntu iso.</li>
        <li>Add it to the kernel? Steal Ubuntu's kernel? Not sure how
        exactly this goes - and cross-compile it.</li>
        <li>Figure out how to package the kernel?</li>
        <li>Figure out how to generate custom Fedora isos.</li>
        </ol>
        <p>These <em>will</em> be done out of order, with Fedora iso
        generation coming first, since I've been trying to figure that
        out for years anyways (the docs are amazing /s).</p>
        <hr />
        <p>[^1] Note that this seems to be mislabeled, as AFAIK both
        these laptops only have the X1E-78-100, not the X1E-80-100.</p>
