        directory</h1>
        <p>Due to btrfs deciding to corrupt itself, I've lost my master
        keys for
        <code>02EF A1CE 3C3E 4AAD 7A86  3AB8 ED24 985C A884 CD61</code>.
        It has not been compromised (as far as I know, at least), and
        everything done with the old key is still valid. Although the
        current subkeys are valid for another 6-ish months (until
        2024-10-09), I'll be moving to a new key proactively.</p>
        <p><strong>My new key is
        <code>CFCF 6723 A8ED 791C 5FD2  5CB5 8589 69DC CC2E 792D</code>.</strong></p>
        <p>This commit will be signed and pushed with the old key,
        <code>0xED24985CA884CD61</code>, then afterwards I will
        immediately be switching to the new key,
        <code>0x858969DCCC2E792D</code>. The old key will be removed
        from my YubiKey and replaced with the new one, and I will be
        unable to read anything encrypted to the old key.</p>
        <hr />
        <p>There's also now a <a href="/data/">/data/</a> directory,
        which as of the time of writing, just contains <a
        href="/data/old-pubkey-02EFA1CE3C3E4AAD7A863AB8ED24985CA884CD61.asc">my
        old key</a> and <a href="/data/new-pgp-key.asc">a detached
        signature</a> for the markdown version of this file (at commit
        <code>5e7ff5e5ad14adc21e2f0ea09d20f3598ae6901c</code>) signed
        with <code>0xED24985CA884CD61</code> saying I'm moving to
        <code>0x858969DCCC2E792D</code>.</p>
        <p><strong>My current PGP public key will always be at <a
        href="/pubkey.asc">/pubkey.asc</a>.</strong></p>
        <p><em>Note</em>: Assuming this actually gets done on April 1st,
        no, this isn't an April Fools joke. If I were to do an April
        Fools joke, it would absolutely have a disclaimer from the
        second it goes up that it's an April Fools joke, but that's a
        rant for another time</p>
